# similar-items-kafka
This repository houses an implementation of finding similar items utilising A-Priori and PCY Algorithms on Apache Kafka. It leverages a 12GB .json file as a sample of the 100+GB Amazon_Reviews Dataset. This was developed as part of an assignment for the course Fundamentals of Big Data Analytics (DS2004).
